The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

American Integrity Insurance Company of Florida values its relationship with you and recognizes that
customer trust is a fundamental element to any successful relationship. American Integrity will protect
your privacy and the personal information we use to provide you with superior products and services.
We want you to understand how we protect the confidentiality of all personal information obtained in the
course of doing business with you. Our pledge is to protect your privacy whether this information is
received by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person.
Personal Information Collected 
American Integrity collects personal information from you when it is necessary in conducting the business
of insurance. Most of the information used in evaluating your application or servicing your policy is shared
with us by you or through your agent. Personal information is also obtained through the claims process.
Depending upon your insurance coverage, we may collect personal information about you from a third
party or a consumer-reporting agency. We also collect information about your transactions with us,
affiliates, or others such as your policy coverage, premiums, payments, and motor vehicle records.
Personal Information Disclosed 
American Integrity does not disclose any personal information about current or former customers to
anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to provide our products and services to
you.
When possible, we advise our vendors and other non-affiliated third parties, to whom we legally provide
your personal information in the course of conducting our insurance business, of the importance and our
commitment to our privacy statement. We make every effort to only use vendors with the same
commitment to customer privacy.
Access to personal information about you is restricted to anyone except those employees, employees of
our affiliates, or others who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
American Integrity works diligently to ensure that our websites are secure. We employ firewalls,
encryption technology, authentication and access control mechanisms to control access to the personal
information that may be shared over these sites. Credit card information is not stored in any database.
This information is kept in a server memory only as long as it is needed.
Verification and Accuracy Rights 
Keeping your personal information accurate and up to date is important to us. You have the right to see
and request corrections to the personal information we collected that you feel is inaccurate except for
information relating to a claim or legal proceeding.
Contacting Us 
Your trust is one of our most valued assets. We will continually work to protect the privacy of our

Personal Information Collected 
American Integrity collects personal information from you when it is necessary in conducting the business
of insurance. Most of the information used in evaluating your application or servicing your policy is shared
with us by you or through your agent. Personal information is also obtained through the claims process.
Depending upon your insurance coverage, we may collect personal information about you from a third
party or a consumer-reporting agency. We also collect information about your transactions with us,
affiliates, or others such as your policy coverage, premiums, payments, and motor vehicle records.
Personal Information Disclosed 
American Integrity does not disclose any personal information about current or former customers to
anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to provide our products and services to
you.
When possible, we advise our vendors and other non-affiliated third parties, to whom we legally provide
your personal information in the course of conducting our insurance business, of the importance and our
commitment to our privacy statement. We make every effort to only use vendors with the same
commitment to customer privacy.
Access to personal information about you is restricted to anyone except those employees, employees of
our affiliates, or others who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
American Integrity works diligently to ensure that our websites are secure. We employ firewalls,
encryption technology, authentication and access control mechanisms to control access to the personal
information that may be shared over these sites. Credit card information is not stored in any database.
This information is kept in a server memory only as long as it is needed.
Verification and Accuracy Rights 
Keeping your personal information accurate and up to date is important to us. You have the right to see
and request corrections to the personal information we collected that you feel is inaccurate except for
information relating to a claim or legal proceeding.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.
