Our Right To Cancel - If your policy has been in effect for 90 days or less and the insurance is cancelled for other
than nonpayment of premium, we may cancel by giving you at least 20 days’ notice before the cancellation effective

misrepresentation, or failure to comply with underwriting requirements, we may cancel immediately.
If your policy has been in effect over 90 days, we may cancel your policy for only a limited number of reasons. The
reasons include, but are not limited to, material misstatement or substantial change of risk. We will cancel by giving
you advance written notice at least 120 days before the cancellation becomes effective.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.
