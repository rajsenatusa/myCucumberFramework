The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

Notice of Premium Discounts for Hurricane Loss Mitigation
About Your Personal Residential Insurance Policy
How can I take advantage of the discounts?
Hurricanes have caused tens of billions of dollars in insured damages and predictions of more
catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in Florida have triggered increases in insurance premiums to
cover potential future losses. Enclosed is information regarding wind loss mitigation that will make your
home more resistant to wind and help protect your family during a catastrophic event. In addition to
reducing your hurricane wind premium by installing mitigation features, you may also reduce the
likelihood of out of pocket expenses, such as your hurricane deductible, you may otherwise incur after a
catastrophic event.
Your location: The closer a home is to the coast, the more vulnerable it is to damage caused by hurricane winds.
Your policy: Your insurance policy is divided into two premiums: one for damage caused by hurricane force winds
(hurricane-wind) and one for all other damage (all perils), such as fire.
The costs of the improvement projects vary. Homeowners should contact a licensed contractor for an estimate. You
can find a Certified Contractor in your area by visiting the Florida Department of Business and Professional
Policy ID:
What factors are considered in establishing my premium?
Regulation online at
Improvements to your home: The state requires insurance companies to offer discounts for protecting your home
against damage caused by hurricane winds. Securing your roof so it doesn’t blow off and protecting your
windows from flying debris are the two most cost effective measures you can take to safeguard your home and

reduce your hurricane –wind premium. These discounts apply only to the hurricane-wind portion of your policy.
Homeowners will need a qualified inspector such as a general, building, or residential contractor licensed under Section
489.111, Florida Statutes, or a professional engineer licensed under Section 471.015, Florida Statutes, who has
passed the appropriate equivalency test of the Building Code training program as required by Section 553.841, Florida
Statutes, or a professional architect licensed under Section 481.213, Florida Statutes, or a building code inspector
certified under Section 468.607, to inspect the home to identify potential mitigation measures and verify improvements.
For a listing of individuals and/or inspection companies meeting these qualifications contact your insurance agent or
insurance company.

Dear John Smith,
Your deductible: Under the law, you are allowed to choose a $500, $1,000 or $2,500 deductible, depending on the
actual value of your home. The larger your deductible, the lower your hurricane-wind premium. However, if you
select a higher deductible your out- of-pocket expenses in the event of a hurricane claim will be higher.
Your maximum discount: Discounts are not calculated cumulatively. The total discount is not the sum of the
individual discounts. Instead, when one discount is applied, other discounts are reduced until you reach your
maximum discount of 90%.

Hurricanes have caused tens of billions of dollars in insured damages and predictions of more
catastrophic hurricanes making landfall in Florida have triggered increases in insurance premiums to
cover potential future losses. Enclosed is information regarding wind loss mitigation that will make your
home more resistant to wind and help protect your family during a catastrophic event. In addition to
reducing your hurricane wind premium by installing mitigation features, you may also reduce the
likelihood of out of pocket expenses, such as your hurricane deductible, you may otherwise incur after a
catastrophic event.
Your location: The closer a home is to the coast, the more vulnerable it is to damage caused by hurricane winds.
Your policy: Your insurance policy is divided into two premiums: one for damage caused by hurricane force winds
(hurricane-wind) and one for all other damage (all perils), such as fire.
The costs of the improvement projects vary. Homeowners should contact a licensed contractor for an estimate. You
can find a Certified Contractor in your area by visiting the Florida Department of Business and Professional

Improvements to your home: The state requires insurance companies to offer discounts for protecting your home

Homeowners will need a qualified inspector such as a general, building, or residential contractor licensed under Section
489.111, Florida Statutes, or a professional engineer licensed under Section 471.015, Florida Statutes, who has
passed the appropriate equivalency test of the Building Code training program as required by Section 553.841, Florida
Statutes, or a professional architect licensed under Section 481.213, Florida Statutes, or a building code inspector
certified under Section 468.607, to inspect the home to identify potential mitigation measures and verify improvements.
For a listing of individuals and/or inspection companies meeting these qualifications contact your insurance agent or
insurance company.

Dear John Smith,
Your deductible: Under the law, you are allowed to choose a $500, $1,000 or $2,500 deductible, depending on the
actual value of your home. The larger your deductible, the lower your hurricane-wind premium. However, if you
select a higher deductible your out- of-pocket expenses in the event of a hurricane claim will be higher.
Your maximum discount: Discounts are not calculated cumulatively. The total discount is not the sum of the
individual discounts. Instead, when one discount is applied, other discounts are reduced until you reach your
maximum discount of 90%.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.

The following checklist is for informational purposes only. Florida law prohibits this checklist from changing any of the
provisions of the insurance contract which is the subject of this checklist. Any endorsement regarding changes in
types of coverage, exclusions, limitations, reductions, deductibles, coinsurance, renewal provisions, cancellation
provisions, surcharges, or credits will be sent separately.
Reviewing this checklist together with your policy can help you gain a better understanding of your policy's actual
coverages and limitations, and may even generate questions. By addressing any questions now, you will be more
prepared later in the event of a claim. Experience has shown that many questions tend to arise regarding the
coverage of attached or detached screened pool enclosures, screened porches, and other types of enclosures.
Likewise, if your policy insures a condominium unit, questions may arise regarding the coverage of certain items,
such as individual heating and air conditioning units; individual water heaters; floor, wall, and ceiling coverings; built-in
cabinets and counter tops; appliances; window treatments and hardware; and electrical fixtures. A clear
understanding of your policy's coverages and limitations will reduce confusion that may arise during claims
settlement.
Please refer to the policy for details and any exceptions to the coverages listed in this checklist. All coverages are
subject to the provisions and conditions of the policy and any endorsements. If you have questions regarding your
policy, please contact your agent or company. Consumer assistance is available from the Department of Financial
Services, Division of Consumer Services' Helpline at (800) 342-2762 or www.fldfs.com.
